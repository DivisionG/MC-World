This is a Repository that isn't done yet and will leak source codes of MC World Network (Which I own) when we go open sourced once we finish the interface. (Only things we won't leak is our minigame code or custom gamemode code) We will only leak our utility codes such as our Chat System, Staff Tools etc. Nothing like an anticheat, minigame coding or gamemode coding.
